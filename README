Standalone java library for decompressing RAR archives. 

This is a fork of the jukka/java-unrar repo, which was a version specifically
for tika, which in turn was a fork of an old sourceforge-host port of the 
unrar library that is no longer available. 

This is library is available from the bedatadriven repo, you can include
in a maven project with the following:

	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>bedatadriven-public</id>
			<url>http://nexus.bedatadriven.com/content/groups/public</url>
